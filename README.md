## About Bal Asha Trust

[Bal Asha Trust](https://www.balashatrust.org/) is a renowned non-profit organization based in India that has been working tirelessly to provide a safe and nurturing environment for orphaned and abandoned children. They have been operating for several years and have successfully facilitated countless adoptions, ensuring that every child finds a loving and caring home.

This project is a collaborative effort by Team 7 to create a web application that streamlines the trust's processes, making it easier to manage child profiles, adoption procedures, and donor information. By providing an intuitive platform, we aim to enhance the efficiency of the organization and ultimately improve the lives of the children under the care of Bal Asha Trust.
